This project aimed to start the odysee of cleaning a data base regarding shark attacks.
In general, it was a challenging project, since you could approach it in many ways. I tried to focus on specific goals, which you will find explicited at the beginning of the data-wrangling document.

I started by importing the data, analisying it, and try to establish some basic first steps to make it cleaner. The most common techniques I put in practice were: 
- Transforming data types 
- Identifying and erasing/susbtituing certain values

I feel that in this project I started to get more familiar with reading documentation, which is something I am not used to, but definitely recognized its value during this challenge. Also, I confirmed the power of diversity. Even when it was an individual project, I got the opportunity to share different points of view with my friend Richo while building the action plan. It's great how different perspectives can make you approach a problem in a much more holistic way.
